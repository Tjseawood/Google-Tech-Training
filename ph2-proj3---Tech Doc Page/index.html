                    The major scale is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western Music. Like
                    many musical scales, it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its
                    frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note.In this document we will discuss how
                    to build major scale and where they are found in modern western culture.

                <h3>Interval</h3>
                <p>
                    Before attempted to build a major scale, we music start with defining an interval. An interval in
                    music is defined as a distance in pitch between any two notes. Is it best to think of intervals as
                    equvilent to letters in the alphabet, they can be strung together to create larger structures;
                    similar to words and sentences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a few intervals but none are most important than the minor 2nd and the major 2nd, also
                    known as a half-step and a whole-step.

                    <em>For similiply, we will reference these 2 intervals as half and whole step for the duration of
                        the document.</em>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C to D = whole-step</li>
                    <li>C to C sharp (D flat) = half-step</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to build a major scale</h3>

                <p>
                    There are seven different notes in each scale. Scale degree refers to the position of each scale
                    note. Each scale note has a scale degree name. For example, C is the first scale degree of C major
                    scale.</p>
                <p>
                    We start by selecting our inital note (a.k.a the root or tonic) them we follow a specific intervalic
                    sequence:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start at the <em><strong>Root</strong></em></li>
                    <li>then ascend up a <em><strong>whole-step</strong></em></li>
                    <li>followed by another <em><strong>whole-step</strong></em></li>
                    <li>then a <em><strong>half-step</strong></em></li>
                    <li>follow up with another <em><strong>whole-step</strong></em></li>
                    <li> then another <em><strong>whole-step</strong></em></li>
                    <li>one more <em><strong>whole-step</strong></em></li>
                    <li>Finally finish with a <em><strong>half-step</strong></em></li>
                </ul>
                This formula is absolute and will always produce a major scale, regardless of the starting pitch. Here
                is another way that it is commony written.

                <code> R W-W-H-W-W-W-H</code>
                </p>
                <h3> Major scale examples:</h3>
                <p>
                    Here is a major scale build from starting on the note C:

                    <code> C D E F G A B C</code>

                    Here is another starting on G:

                    <code> G A B C D E F# G </code>

                    Here is one more starting on the note B:

                    <code> B C# D# E F# G# A# B</code>

                    Although they have their difference in appearence, they all follow the exact same formula for building a
                    major scale and thus feel the same when heared.

                    Becuase if it's wide spread popularity in Western culture, the major scale (and it's variations) are
                    heard in a variety of context. It exist as a universal concept, therefore it has found its place in
                    every genre of music. Here just a few examples:
